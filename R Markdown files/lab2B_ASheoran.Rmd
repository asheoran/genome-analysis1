Exercise 1
```{r}
x <- c(1,3,6,9,12)
y <- c(1,0,1,0,1)
x-y
x*y
x/y
```

Exercise 2
```{r}
x <- c(0,1,2,3)
y <- c("aa","bb","cc","dd")
z <- c("aa",1,"bb",2)
str(x)
str(y)
str(z)
```

Exercise 3
```{r}
Genotype1 <- c("AA","AA","AG","GG","GG")
Genotype2 <- c("AA","AA","GG","GG","GG")
G <- cbind(Genotype1,Genotype2)
G
table(G)
```

Exercise 4
```{r}
time <- c(0,2,4,6,8)
treatment1 <- c(0,1,2,3,4)
treatment2 <- c(0,2,4,6,8)
treatment3 <- c(0,3,6,9,12)
Sample <- data.frame(time,treatment1, treatment2,treatment3)
Sample
plot(treatment3,time)
```

Exercise 5
```{r}
SNP_table1 <- read.table("23andMe_complete.txt", header = TRUE, sep ="\t")
SNP_table1
str(SNP_table1)
```
This file is different than the truncated file because it reaches a max capacity of rows.

Exercise 6
```{r}
table(SNP_table1)
```

Exercise 7
```{r}
SNP_table_A <- subset(SNP_table, genotype == 'A')
SNP_table_A
```
